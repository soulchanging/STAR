# STAR: Enhancing Visual Reinforcement Learning with State-Action Representation

This is an original PyTorch implementation of STAR from [Enhancing Visual Reinforcement Learning with State-Action Representation]

## Method

STAR is a simple visual RL framework which introduces a state-action joint representation considering the interaction between states and actions,
and uses it to enhance the input of the ùëÑ-functions.
